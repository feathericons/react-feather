#### Based on Feather Icons  ```v4.26.0```

#### Version `2.0.0` adds support for tree-shaking, to help you reduce bundle size.

### Installation
    npm install react-feather --save

### Usage

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Camera } from 'react-feather';

const App = () => {
  return <Camera />
};

export default App;
```

Icons can be configured with inline props:
```javascript
<Camera color="red" size={48} />
```

If you can't use ES6 imports, it's possible to include icons from the compiled folder ./dist.
```javascript
var Camera = require('react-feather/dist/icons/camera').default;

var MyComponent = React.createClass({
  render: function () {
    return (
      <Camera />
    );
  }
});
```
You can also include the whole icon pack:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import * as Icon from 'react-feather';

const App = () => {
  return <Icon.Camera />
};

export default App;
```
